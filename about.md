I am a Localization Professional with academic background in
environmental science and engineering. Recently, I got inspired
by a friend and started my journey with SoftUni, eventually
realizing a dream: Learning to program! And since then, I have
loved it! I am looking forward to start a career as a software
engineer, working with and learning in new teams and
collaborating in interesting projects.

I recently completed the Python - Django ORM and HTML, CSS
courses at SoftUni.

Currently I am learning JS Front-End. I'm looking forward to
take the Python Web module in the program and eventually
creating some interesting projects.
